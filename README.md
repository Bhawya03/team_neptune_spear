Problem statement : More than 4% of Odisha's total land area is covered by its coastline. There are more than 5 districts that are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters.So we are expected to develop a solution that will be used to inform the public days before any such circumstances arise. A way of letting people know what is going on and enlightening them, as well as giving them a way to avoid being excluded from their secure lives.
Tech stack used by us: HTML, CSS ,Javascript.
It is just a basic prototype for our project, using html, css and just a few things on javascript.
